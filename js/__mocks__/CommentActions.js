  text: 'Hi everyone, this is my first chatbot. I made it in php with the awesome botman.io framework (really recommended!).<p>I created this bot because polls are useful but terribly boring, so I decided to change a bit the voting strategy to make it more fun. I believe you never seen such a voting strategy in polls apps.<p>The bot is currently available for:<p>- Telegram: telegram.me&#x2F;PixideBot?start=join-nLD6O<p>- Facebook Messenger: m.me&#x2F;pixideapp?ref=join-nLD6O<p>Please let me know your thoughts, it&#x27;s the first release so I&#x27;m very open to feedback!\nThanks',
